  "bio": "I'm a pre-final year undergraduate at IIIT Hyderabad, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I have a demonstrated history of leading tech teams across multiple domains. I focus on delivering key outcomes and swiftly adjusting to new learnings to solve problems. I'm a natural at putting big ideas into action under pressure.",
  "description": "I'm a goal-driven husky who loves to use modern technologies to solve user problems. \n I'm a firm believer in the potential of rural development schemes. I sleep well knowing that I'm doing my best to make the lives of the less fortunate better. To achieve this, I have been working with several Not-for-profit organizations and startups over the last two years. It's very fulfilling to work at startups as I can work closely with the founding team and grow with the company! \n I'm an avid admirer of the open-source world. I have had the pleasure of contributing to and being part of some of the most incredible communities such as Dask, NumFOCUS, Google Cirq, Joomla!, OpenMRS, LibreHealth, RTEMS and CCExtractor. I'm grateful to Google Summer of Code for kindling my love for open-source, first as a student and then as a mentor! \n In my free time, I watch lectures on Computer Networking and Finance Technology. I aspire to work professionally in these fields as I mature into my career. \n I'm always looking forward to an insightful conversation over snacks or, even better, a game of cricket!"
